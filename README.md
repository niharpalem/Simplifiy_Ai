# AI Theory & Code — Unified Knowledge Repository

A concise, structured collection of my personal understanding of AI/ML theory, research papers, and practical implementations. This repository captures how I interpret, simplify, and translate complex concepts into clear mathematics, intuitive explanations, and working code. While many implementations are AI-assisted, each piece reflects a personalized learning process, human insight, and my own unique way of understanding modern AI systems.

## 📚 What This Repository Includes

- 🧠 **Theory notes** simplifying research papers into digestible concepts  
- 🔢 **Mathematical breakdowns** of algorithms, loss functions, and derivations  
- 🧩 **Code implementations** across deep learning, RL,VLM, Diffusion Models, Agentic Systems
- 🔬 **Experiments and ablations** demonstrating model behaviors and insights  
- 🧪 **Step-by-step walkthroughs** explaining architectures and training loops  
- ⚙️ **Utility scripts** and reusable components for training and evaluation
